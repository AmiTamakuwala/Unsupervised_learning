Mastering unsupervised learning opens up a broad range of avenues for a data scientist. There is so much scope in the vast expanse of unsupervised learning and yet a lot of beginners in machine learning tend to shy away from it. In fact, I’m sure most newcomers will stick to basic clustering algorithms like K-Means clustering and hierarchical clustering.
Clustering is an essential technique in machine learning and is used widely across domains and industries (think about Uber’s route optimization, Amazon’s recommendation system, Netflix’s customer segmentation, and so on).
